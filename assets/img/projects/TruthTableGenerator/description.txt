I developed a Truth Table Generator Android App. Truth Tables are heavily used in discrete mathematics, electronics and digital logic design. I first designed a truth table parser and solver that could generate truth tables given input proposition statement. I implemented the program to work with all the logical operators namely AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR and (). It also had the ability to compare multiple propositions side by side and compare their results (implemented on customer's request). The parsing and generation engine that i wrote from scratch was a very complex yet efficient java program. The results were verified from a stanford univeristy parsing engine. I developed it when i was just in my first semester of university but the data structures support, program  architecture and implementation of algorithms were perfectly splendid. Once the parsing engine was done, i developed an eye catching android application UI and released it to play store. It ranked first on google play store for it's category and received 10,000+ downloads with a 4.9 rating.
