It is one of the best projects I have ever done. I had to develop a comic engine that would take korean comic images and convert them to english. It was a big project and needed high level of expertise and intellect to accomplish. Breaking it down to modules it had to: Detect korean text, Segment it, Save it as textual data, Inpaint it from the original image without any traces, Translate korean text to english text and finally Super Impose it to the original image such that it doesn't look odd. I was the in-charge of the whole project and led the other developers involved in the project. Google translate wasn't able to provide the best korean translation, therefore a bot was developed to translate the korean text from a website. Since the bot couldn't run alongside the text recognizer, I created a specific file format where the data and the meta data of the recognized korean text was saved. A bot was then used to provide translation for the korean text from an online website. Once done a super-imposer python program was written that took those files and super imposed english text on to the original images. In an update to the project, i also coded multi-threading that boosted performance. The buyer was so happy to see the end project as it exceeded his expectations. He was amazed by both my coding and leadership abilities i had demonstrated for this project. This program was then used by him to run his comic business.
