It’s rare that you come across standout talent like Hissan. I was amazed at his ability to help me understand my problem better and work on how to solve it effectively. He gave me really good ideas and helped fill my gap in the knowledge. Above all, I was impressed with his graphical analysis for Neural Network's. Worked on data imbalance, graphical analysis, over and under sampling and using machine learning classifiers like Random Forest and Tensor Flow. The overall deep learning processes were done excellently.
