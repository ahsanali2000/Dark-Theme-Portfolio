Hissan is truly one the most talented at his field. He has already successfully managed to train a convolutional neural network model for our problem and gave promising results. He has good leadership skills, we were not sure how we are gonna collect the dataset, but he took in-charge of the whole project and guided us along the way. Also his deep passion and keen interest in constantly further improving himself a very valuable source. Hissaan will undoubtedly achieve great success and I cannot wait to see him doing so.
